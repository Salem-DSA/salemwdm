              Payroll taxes and levies have their place in delivering an affordable city for all. But 
              Julie Hoy, Vanessa Nordyke, and the do-nothing City Council have endlessly raised expenses on working 
              families while letting the wealthiest in Salem coast by without chipping in. It is time to stop making 
              workers foot all the bills; the rich can pay their share.

                Salem Workers Demand a 1.5% Income Tax on household income over $200,000, adjusted annually for inflation.

                Salem Workers Demand a 3% Income Tax on household income over $400,000, adjusted annually for inflation.

                Salem Workers Demand a responsible safety budget that restores Fiscal Year 25 spending levels on the police. 
                The Salem Police Department will survive without their Downtown Police Palace or the newest cruisers. It is 
                time we put housing, transportation, and affordability for Salem’s working class ahead of purchasing new toys 
                for the police.
