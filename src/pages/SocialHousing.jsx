              Housing is a human right. Countless homeless neighbors will spend another night sleeping 
              at the foot of an empty high-rise in our Downtown. Meanwhile, investors continue to build 
              modern complexes in the hills of South and West Salem that only the richest can afford 
              to live in. We cannot rely on greedy landlords and developers to give us affordable housing.

                Salem Workers Demand that the City Council Tax the Rich to produce a transformational amount 
                of social housing units over the next two years. These units must provide dignified relief 
                for workers by basing costs on our needs, not profits, and by asking our wealthy neighbors 
                to pay their fair share. These must be homes, not just four walls and a roof, that are desirable 
                and competitive with the market because they are owned and operated for the public good.

                Salem Workers Demand that the City Council Tax the Rich to protect tenants and fight back against 
                abusive landlords by creating a Landlord Accountability Department (LAD). Salem’s LAD must hire 
                full-time call-center workers to staff a 24/7 hotline for reporting criminal landlord behavior. 
                Salem’s LAD must also hire full-time inspectors to enforce the law.

                Salem Workers Demand a Vacancy Tax in the City of Salem for greedy landlords and corporations 
                hoarding vacant properties. The former Kmart off of Mission Street should not be absorbing tax 
                writeoffs while people sleep on the street.
