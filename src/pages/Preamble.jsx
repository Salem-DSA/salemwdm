              For too long, the Salem City Council has served the interests of their bosses in the big business lobby, 
              the corporate landlord class, and the Salem Police Department. Meanwhile, working people find it 
              harder every day to cover a trip to the grocery store, the commute to work, or a roof over their head. 
              It is time that Salem’s working class take our government and our economy back from the ruling rich to 
              deliver an affordable city that everyone can call home. We call on Julie Hoy, Vanessa Nordkye, and their 
              do-nothing City Council to unequivocally declare that Salem Workers Deserve More.
