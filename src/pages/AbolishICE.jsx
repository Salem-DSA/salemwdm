              Our immigrant neighbors out in the fields, behind the register, or in the kitchen are not our 
              enemy. It is Cheryl Wolfe (CEO of Salem Health), the Salem Chamber of Commerce, and the Salem 
              Police Department who have made this city unaffordable and unlivable. While armed and masked 
              federal agents ransack the city to kidnap families, the ruling rich rob us blind with no opposition. 
              Salem Workers Deserve a life free from occupation and abduction. No one is illegal, and we call on 
              Julie Hoy, Vanessa Nordyke, and their do-nothing City Council to declare a local State of Emergency 
              to stand with immigrants.

                Salem Workers Demand that the City Council make Salem the Strongest Sanctuary City in the State through 
                several immediate measures:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      Direct all school campuses within the City of Salem, public and private, to issue explicit sanctuary 
                      campus policies. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Direct all buildings regulated and owned by the City of Salem to deny their facilities to ICE under 
                      strict financial and criminal penalties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Direct the Salem Police Department to arrest ICE agents conducting illegal raids or detentions. It 
                      is the job of the police to enforce the law if it is violated. The primary oath of both local officers 
                      and federal agents is to the Constitution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Salem Workers Demand that the City Council Tax the Rich to invest in immigrants, not ICE. The City of Salem 
                must end all contracts with ICE and companies that contract with ICE, effective immediately. We demand that 
                the City Council establish a Legal Defense Fund (LDF) for immigrants kidnapped by ICE.
              </li>
              <li>
                Salem Workers Demand that the City Council endorse the call to Abolish ICE as a government body. We do not 
                elect our representatives to quietly stand by as fascists kill what remains of democracy and human rights. 
                The City Council has an opportunity to demonstrate political courage and political will by telling ICE to get 
                out of our town.
